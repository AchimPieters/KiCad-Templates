  <h3>Raspberry Pi<sup>&reg;</sup> Zero W - Hat Template</h3>
  <P>This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/" target="_blank"> Raspberry Pi<sup>&reg;</sup> Zero W </a><br><br>
    This base project includes a PCB edge defined as the same size as the
    Raspberry Pi<sup>&reg;</sup> Zero W PCB with the connectors placed correctly to align
    the two boards. All IO present on the Raspberry-Pi board is connected
    to the project through the 0.1&quot; expansion headers.<br><br>Example of the board outline<br><IMG SRC="brd.png" NAME="brd" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=680 HEIGHT=378 BORDER=0>
